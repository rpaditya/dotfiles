%% This is a sample startup file for the slrn newsreader and meant as a
%% template for your personal startup file; it is not a full reference
%% of slrn's config options -- please see the reference manual for this.

%% The percent character is used for comments.

%
%% 1. Tell slrn about your identity (name, email address and such)
%

% The "From:" header will be generated from the following three variables.
% With the example settings, it would read "john@doe.com (John Doe)".
set username "aditya"
set hostname "grot.org"
set realname "R.P. Aditya"

% Set this if you want replies to your articles to go to a address different
% from the one in "From:".
% set replyto  "aditya@grot.org"

% What to put into the "Organization:" header line.
set organization "grot.org"

% The name of your signature file.  If "", no signature is added.
%set signature ".signature"

%
%% 2. Server specific settings
%

% Tell slrn which newsrc file it should use for which server.
% Note: This does *not* set the default server; you need to set the
%       NNTPSERVER environment variable for this.
%server "news.doe.com" ".jnewsrc-doe"

% If a server requires authentication, add a nnrpaccess line for it.
% If you leave username and/or password empty, slrn will prompt for it.
%nnrpaccess "news.doe.com" "john" "secret"

% Some servers require authentication, but don't ask for it.
% To offer your authentication data "voluntarily", set this variable to 1.
set force_authentication 0

% This can either be set to "nntp" (read online) or "spool" (use local spool)
%set server_object "nntp"

% This can be "nntp" (post directly to the server), "inews" (use external
% program for posting) or "slrnpull" (spool message for slrnpull to send).
%set post_object "nntp"

% Set this to zero if you want to leave Message-ID generation to your server
% or your system does not have a proper unique hostname.
%set generate_message_id 1

% If non-zero, slrn reads the active file on each startup.  You might want to
% use this if your network connection is fast or the server has few groups.
set read_active 0

% from: http://ft.bewatermyfriend.org/comp/slrn/slrnrc.html

%%% check for new groups when checking for new articles?
    set check_new_groups 0

%%% if there are new groups on the server,
%%% i don't care. unsubscribe them by default
    set unsubscribe_new_groups 1

%%% drop groups from newsrc when server drops them
    set drop_bogus_groups 1

%%% slrn manual:
%%% If 0, save all groups when writing newsrc file
%%% if 1, do not save any unsubscribed groups
%%% if 2, do not save any unread-unsubscribed groups
    set write_newsrc_flags 1

%
%% 3. Which external programs do you want to use?
%

% Set your favourite editor.  Use %s for the file name and %d for the line
% where the cursor should be placed (usually at the beginning of the body).
%set editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp"
%set editor_command "jove %s"
set editor_command "~/.mutt/editor.sh %s"

% You can have separate commands for editing posts, mail, and score files.
%set mail_editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp --mail-mode"
%set post_editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp --mail-mode"
%set score_editor_command "jed '%s' -g %d -tmp --score-arrange-score"

set mail_editor_command "/usr/local/bin/mutt -H '%s'"
set mail_editor_is_mua 1

% If non-zero, abort posting or email operation if the file was not modified
% by the editor.
%set abort_unmodified_edits 0

% Command to use for printing
% Note: On Win32, this variable defines the name of the printer queue to use.
%set printer_name "lpr -Plp"

% In case you want to use another mailer than sendmail.  Be sure that it
% implements the same interface, though!
%set sendmail_command "/usr/lib/sendmail -oi -t -oem -odb"

% Set this to one if you want the "From:" header in e-mails to be generated
% from the hostname / username / realname variable.
% Note: Not all MTAs are configured to allow this.
set generate_email_from 1

%
%% 4. Directory / file names
%

% Note: All filenames in this section are relative to HOME unless they start
%       with a '/'.

% Filename where articles / email you sent are archived.
% Note: If these are unset, slrn does not keep a copy of outgoing messages.
set save_posts "News/My_Posts"
set save_replies "News/My_Replies"

% File where failed posts are appended.  Use "" to disable saving.
%set failed_posts_file "dead.letter"

% Name of score file.
set scorefile "News/Score"

% Name of directory where decoded files are placed.
set decode_directory "News"
  
% Directory where all other files are saved.
set save_directory "News"

% Directory where postponed articles are placed. Please make sure it exists.
set postpone_directory "News/postponed"

% Whether to put temporary files for postings, followups and replies in the
% directory specified by the TMPDIR environment variable or /tmp.
set use_tmpdir 0

%
%% 5. Attribution lines / custom headers
%

% This sets the attribution lines for follow-ups and replies.  The following
% format specifiers are recognized:
%  %d:date, %D:date (formatted), %r:real name, %R:first name,
%  %f:email address, %s:subject, %m:msgid, %n:newsgroups, %%: percent
set followup_string "On %D, %r <%f> wrote:"
%set reply_string "In %n, you wrote:"

% Custom headers to add to *new* posts
%set custom_headers "Mail-Copies-To: nobody"

% Custom headers for followup/reply/supersedes.  These can use format
% specifiers as in the 'followup_string' variable.
%set followup_custom_headers "Mail-Copies-To: nobody"
%set reply_custom_headers "X-newsgroup: %n\nX-realname: %r"
%set supersedes_custom_headers "X-Superseded-Date: %d"

% These are inserted when sending email CCs of your postings.
% cc_post_string currently does not support any % escapes.
%set cc_followup_string "[This message has also been posted to %n.]"
%set cc_post_string "[This message has also been posted.]"

%
%% 6. Character mapping / MIME support
%

% Character set used for the local display; valid values are:
%   isolatin, ibm850, ibm852, next, koi8
%set charset isolatin

% Character set to declare when posting 8bit characters. Do *not* use
% the same value as for "charset" here.
%set mime_charset "iso-8859-1"

% You may set this to a comma-separated list of MIME charsets your terminal
% is capable to display. The example adds two Chinese charsets:
%compatible_charsets "Big5,gb2312"

% If non-zero, call metamail for MIME formats slrn cannot handle.
set use_metamail 1

% In case we need metamail to display an article:
%set metamail_command "/usr/local/bin/metamail"
%set metamail_command "/usr/admin/aditya/bin/metamutt"

% WWW browser to use. Xbrowser is used when the DISPLAY environment variable
% is set; non_Xbrowser otherwise.
set non_Xbrowser "w3m '%s'"
set Xbrowser "w3m '%s'"
%set Xbrowser "netscape '%s' &"

%
%% 7. Some preferences for the header window (see the manual for more)
%

% These sorting methods are available:
% If 0, do not sort.  If 1, perform threading.  If 2, sort by subject.
% If 3, thread then sort result by subject.
% If 4, sort by score.  If 5, thread then sort by score.
% If 6, sort by score and subject.
% If 7, thread, then sort by score and subject.
% If 8, sort by date with most recent first.
% If 9, thread, then sort by date with most recent first.
% If 10, sort by date with most recent last.
% If 11, thread then sort by date with most recent last.
set sorting_method 11

% If non-zero, a header with a new subject will start a new thread.
set new_subject_breaks_threads 0

%
%% 8. Some preferences for the article pager (see the manual for more)
%

% Which headers do you want to see by default?
% You can also match all headers starting with a given string and exclude
% specific headers by preceding them with "!" (e.g. use "X-,!X-Trace:" to
% display all the "X-"headers except "X-Trace:").
visible_headers "From:,Date:,Subject:,Newsgroups:,Followup-To:,Reply-To:"

% What to wrap when wrapping an article: 
% 0 or 4 ==> wrap body 
% 1 or 5 ==> wrap headers, body 
% 2 or 6 ==> wrap quoted text, body 
% 3 or 7 ==> wrap headers, quoted text, body 
% The higher number indicates that every article will be automatically 
% wrapped. 
set wrap_flags 7

% If non-zero, #v+ and #v- will be interpreted as markers of verbatim lines.

%% 9. Display / color settings
%

% If non-zero, slrn will draw the thread tree using simple ascii characters
%set simulate_graphic_chars 0

% Enable xterm/win32 mouse support: 1 to enable, 0 to disable
%set mouse 0

% Draw cursor bar ala tin instead of slrn "->" cursor?
set display_cursor_bar	1

% Set to 1 to have slrn scroll by full page instead of by line.
%set scroll_by_page 0

% Should color be used to indicate the score of an article?
% (0) scores do not influence colors (1) scores are colored by their value
% (2) subjects are colored by score  (3) both are colored by score
%set color_by_score 3

% If non-zero, the subjects of unread articles are highlighted
